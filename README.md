# RAVEN

A web api built using [DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) as a interface for jSka tools.

The applications intended purpose is to provided Ground System Engineers (GSE) and Mission Operators (MOps) a front-end to JWST Engineering Telemetry Archive (JETA) during anomaly response activities. JETA is a component of jSka, which was derived from the Ska tools for the Chandra spacecraft, as a superset of those tools retro fitted for JWST. Thelma is designed to encapsulate the most commonly used tools and displays for rapid anomaly response and analysis. The capability to manage the telemetery archive and monitor archive status via a browser is also a key feature of the
application.

## Getting Started

- TBD

### Prerequisites

For a list of python packages required to run the application see requirements.txt in repository root.

Thelma depends on a separete RESTful API [RAVEN](https://github.com/spacetelescope/RAVEN) to handle the direct interface with jSka.

## Environment Variables

For local development environment variables configured in a `.env` file. These same variables
need to be set inside the Docker container for running on server in test or production.


```bash
# Service-level Variables
WORKERS=2
PORT=8002

# Application-level Variables
# THELMA_SECRET_KEY maps directly and is used in the same way as https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#secret-key
THELMA_SECRET_KEY=<a secret key>

# Version Information
# Follows closely the semver.org definition
MAJOR_VERSION=1
MINOR_VERSION=0
PATCH_LEVEL=0
RELEASE=pre-alpha

# TELEMETRY API Variables
TELEMETRY_API_HOST=<fqdn of API host>
TELEMETRY_API_PORT=<api port>

# Django Configuration
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.base

# Not relevant when running locally, but matters on a remote dev, test or prod server.
# Must be provided by sys/network admin. The default below is for Mac docker's defaults.
